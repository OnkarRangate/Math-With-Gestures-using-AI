# Math-With-Gestures-using-AI
# 🧠✋ Maths with Gestures using AI

An AI-powered project that enables users to perform basic math operations using **hand gestures** instead of traditional input methods. Designed with accessibility and innovation in mind, this application uses **computer vision** and **machine learning** to recognize hand signs and convert them into mathematical expressions.

## 🚀 Features

- ✋ Real-time **gesture recognition** using webcam
- ➕ Perform math operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division and Complex Operation
- 🧮 Displays recognized numbers and operations on screen
- 🖥️ Simple and user-friendly interface
- 🧠 Built using **AI models** trained to detect finger counts and gesture patterns

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **OpenCV** – For video capture and image processing
- **MediaPipe** or **TensorFlow** – For hand gesture detection
- **NumPy / math libraries** – For calculations
- **Streamlit** – For the interface

---

## 📷 How It Works

1. The webcam captures hand gestures in real-time.
2. The AI model detects finger positions and matches them to pre-trained gestures.
3. The system maps gestures to numbers and operations.
4. The result is displayed after evaluating the expression.
